## Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

Machine Learning model to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.

The dataset has been collected and analysed during a research collaboration of Worldline and the Machine Learning Group (http://mlg.ulb.ac.be) of ULB (Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles) on big data mining and fraud detection.

The model utilizes Anomaly Detection to find out fraudulent transactions. Anomaly detection is the process of identifying unexpected items or events in data sets.

I have performed Anomaly Detection using three algorithms
1) Isolation Forest
2) Local Outlier Factor
3) Support Vector Machine

After a comparison of the three algorithms, Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor performed much better than Support Vector Machines.
